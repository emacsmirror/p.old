The Emacsmirror
===============

The Emacsmirror collects [Emacs][emacs] Lisp packages and distributes
them in form of [Git][git] repositories -- one per package.

Packages are mirrored from Git repositories at [Github][github] and
elsewhere, from repositories using other vc systems, the
[Emacswiki][wiki], and plain text files. Regardless of what upstream
uses, on the Emacsmirror each package is available as a Git
repository.

Not all packages are mirrored but with it's about 3400 packages the
Emacsmirror is by far the largest and also most up-to-date collection
available. Packages are updated several times per week. Instead of
keeping them around forever obsolete and/or abandoned packages are
moved to the [Emacsattic][attic], where they are no longer
updated.

### Tell me about missing/outdated packages

Please use the [issue tracker][issues] to report missing and outdates
packages.  Also please tell me when upstream has moved.

### This is a mirror, don't send pull requests

Please send pull requests to the upstream maintainers.  I don't know
enough about each and every mirrored packages to decide whether a
patch is good.  Also getting your change merged upstream is preferable
because then everyone can benefit.
