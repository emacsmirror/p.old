The Emacsmirror
===============

The Emacsmirror collects [Emacs][emacs] Lisp packages and distributes
them in form of [Git][git] repositories -- one per package.

Emacsmirror's issue tracker
---------------------------

While projects on Github come with an issue tracker that isn't
available for accounts. So this fake project `p` serves as the issue
tracker of the `emacsmirror` organisation.

Tell me about missing/outdated packages
---------------------------------------

Please use the [issue tracker][issues] to report missing and outdates
packages.  Also please tell me when upstream has moved.

This is a mirror, don't send pull requests
------------------------------------------

Please send pull requests to the upstream maintainers.  I don't know
enough about each and every mirrored packages to decide whether a
patch is good.  Also getting your change merged upstream is preferable
because then everyone can benefit.
