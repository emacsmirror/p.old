* Emacsmirror's Issue Tracker and Wiki

While projects on github come with an issue tracker and a wiki those tools
are not available on the account level. So this fake project =p= serves as
the issue tracker and the wiki of the =emacsmirror= organisation.  The wiki
won't be used much - among other things because it's rather broken.
